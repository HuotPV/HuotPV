ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Pierre-Vincent Huot, currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at KULeuven.

I'm interested in the dynamics of the coupled air-sea system, especially in the polar regions (my main focus is on Antarctica). 
I try to understand how the ocean and the atmosphere interacts, how these interactions varies with the spatial and temporal scales considered, and what does it mean for the future of the cryosphere.

I have mainly worked on regional air-sea-ice coupled models, and I'm looking forward to learn more advanced data analysis methods.
